- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

For the Cafe class, I decided to overload the sellCoffee() method so that a simple black coffee could be sold with no creams or sugars, having a default of nothing added when this version of the method is called.
I also overloaded the restock() method to support this version of the sellCoffee() method so that the restock() method could be called in the overloaded method as well and only restock the ounces of coffee, not the creams or sugars which are not needed for this order.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
